Original geometry based on: 30mm NATO APFSDS model on GrabCAD

The CAD model was used as a starting point for hand-drawn and simulated geometry.
Modifications were made to support thermal simulation and material studies:
Steel nose, aluminum outer shielding, and a tungsten core
A small gap between core and shielding was added to reflect realistic construction methods (e.g., bonding layer or thermal standoff)
Dimensions and material interfaces were estimated using publicly available data on high-speed dart-type projectiles
This geometry is used purely for open-source physics-based analysis and does not reflect classified or proprietary system details.
